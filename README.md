## Usage

Open the website and input the data at the top. It's separated by any whitespace and commas (the regex `/[\s,]+/` for all the programmers out there).

## Motivation

Please take a moment to observe this abomination someone dared to call a maths problem:

![The very definition of shitfuckery.](./shitfuckery.png)

Now, there is **_no way in hell_** that I'm going to sort that by hand. So I'm making the computer do it. Whoever made this maths problem can go kiss my ass. And to whoever created this excuse of a maths problem, _fuck you to the moon_.
